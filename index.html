            <p>
                I am an incomming Senior at Palo Alto Senior High School. I love to hang
                out with my friends and travel to new places. My favorite food is Lasagna
                and Ravioli. My family is from Durango, Mexico.

            Outside of school I enjoy hanging out with friends and doing out door events. I have recently been
            training to do the Half Dome Hike in Yosemite National Park. It is a 11 mile hike up a stone mountain
            it is something new and I hope I will be able to participate in the even. Last summer I was a summer
            school TA for incoming freshman I helped them understand Algebra 1 and I was lucky enough to have my brother
            in my class. Along with that this summer I will be spending my summer in Girls Who Code learning different
            programing lanugaes to hopefully find an interest in an career in Computer Science. So far my first career
            choice is Architect.
